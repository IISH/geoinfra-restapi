Modules and their division and purpose

index.js
--------
runs the express app.


pgapi-bridge
------------
sends requests to postgres and gets them back.



Data flow
=========
Let's examin the flow of data to see what interfaces we need to provide.

*http input*: a GET request comes in with a url and parameters. Something like: `http://api.example.org/search?name=austria&after=1800&before=1900`

We need to *parse* this to find out the route and the search arguments. Do this in the _params_ module. Then we get:

    path: search
    args:
        name: austria
        after: 1800
        before: 1900
    modifiers:  #could be things like geom=true or exact_match=false.
        none

Express takes care of routing. But we need to check the parameters in the future, validate them.


We need to select which backend we're going to use.

Then for Postgres, we need to translate our requests to SQL. This is domain-specific.
